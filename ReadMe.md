fb-doc
======

Welcome to the fb-doc package. It's a tool for generating documentation
from and for FreeBasic source code. Rather than creating the
documentation output directly, fb-doc is designed to close the gap
between FreeBasic (= FB) and C syntax to allow for using any C / C++
documentation tool-chain. Also it supports the creation of
documentational comments in the source and it can get extended via
external plugins.
