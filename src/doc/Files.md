![Files used or generated by fb-doc](Overview.png)

fb-doc currently uses two external files. It tries to load the 
context when needed and continues without the context when the files 
aren't present. fb-doc searches for the files in the EXEPATH (the 
folder of the fb-doc binary).

\section sectFileCsrc ../doc/c_src

This folder gets created by fb-doc to write the file output. It's 
used to collect the translations from the \em C_Source emitter. The 
back-end read its input from here.

\section sectFileLfn fb-doc.lfn

The suffix lfn means list of function names. This file is used in the
C_Source emitter to create pseudo function calls in a function body. It
gets created by the ListOfFunction emitter when using (option
Â´--list-mode`) and it isn't used in Geany mode (option `--geany-mode`,
emitters GtkDocTemplates and DoxygenTemplates).

Allthough it's usually created by fb-doc, it also can get 
manipulated by any text editor.

The file contains the names of all functions in the source code. 
Member functions of a UDT are listed as they are named in the 
function body (ie TypeName.FunctionName). The first line is empty. 
Further lines contain the names, one in each line, including the dot 
in case of a member function. The lines \b must be separated by a 
single line feed character (LINUX line end = 'CHR(10)'). So be 
careful when we edit on DOS / windows (ie use Geany and switch to 
LF line ends).

This file is needed when running as a filter for Doxygen to create 
the caller and callees graphs. Therefor the bodys of the function 
have to include the function calls. fb-doc checks all words in a 
function body against the known function names. Any match gets 
emitted as a pseudo function call (with empty parameter list).

Since in this mode Doxygen serves the file names in any order and 
fb-doc gets started new for each file, it doesn't know about a 
function declaration from file A when working on file B. Therefor the
function names have to be served from an external source. They get 
red from this file at each program start.

The file offers an additional way to control the context of the caller 
and callees graphs. Only functions listed in this file gets included 
in the C source (and in the graphs).

When this file isn't present fb-doc continues execution without any 
message and the function bodys of the pseudo C code are empty. This 
means no caller or callees graphs will be created.


\section sectFilePlugin External Moduls (*.so / *.dll)

fb-doc can use external emitter modules. These are executable 
binaries, compiled and linked as a library for dynamic linkage, 
either by using the FreeBasic compiler or any other compiler / linker
combination. These files may have any name and get the system 
specific file name extension (= suffix) \em .so on LINUX or \em .dll 
on windows.

Such files aren't necessary for basic usage of fb-doc. They are used 
for external emitters to extend the fb-doc features and get loaded on 
demand (option `--emitter`) at run-time, see \ref pageExtend for 
details. So you may have one or more files with one of these 
suffixes in your working directory.
