Files and Folders  {#PagFiles}
=================
\tableofcontents

\Proj operates on input and generates output, that is either pipe
streams (`STDIN` and `STDOUT`) or to files. The run mode determines
which kind of input to get, where to get it from and where to write the
output at, see first table in section \ref SecIntExe for an overview.

This chapter contains detailed informations on the different file types
used by fc-doc for input or output. Here's a grafical overview

![Files used or generated by fb-doc](Overview.png)


# Files  {#SecFiles}

## Input  {#SubInput}

Input files get read in all run modes except \ref SecModGeany. At least
one file of the first catagory (`*.bas` / `*.bi`) is used in any case.
The other files are used by specific emitters and run modi.


### *.bas / *.bi  {#SubInBasBi}

The standard input of \Proj is FreeBASIC source code, stored in files
with the suffix `*.bas` or `*.bi`. The Parser is designed to operate on
this files. It doesn't evaluate all the code, just documentation
related constructs get sent to the related emitter functions.

\Proj is designed to operate on error-free source code. Usually the
documentation gets done after the code has been checked. So \Proj
contains just a minimal set of syntax checks, it relys on input
previously validated by the FB compiler.


### fb-doc.lfn  {#SubInLfn}

The suffix means List of File Names. This file is optional. It's used
by emitter \ref SecEmmCSource in order to generate caller / callee
graphs and it's located in the Doxygen folder near the configuration
file `Doxyfile`.

The file usually gets generated by \Proj in run mode \ref SecModList
with its default emitter \ref SecEmmLfn, but it can get manipulated
manualy by any text editor. The file contains a comment in the first
line, followed by list of function names, one name per line. Entries
for member functions contain the class name and the function name,
separated by a dot. The lines are separated by new line characters.
(Only `!"\n"`, but no `!"\c"` is allowed, so be careful when editing
the file on non-LINUX systems.)


Those names are used to generate calls in function bodies in the pseudo
C intermediate syntax for Doxygen back end.

Background: When \Proj runs as a Doxygen filter (default mode), it gets
called for a single input file and pipes output to `STDOUT`. At this
moment, \Proj doesn't know about function declarations in the other
source files.

In order to generate caller / callee graphs by Doxygen, the output must
contain the function calls in the function bodies. To generate those
function calls in the intermediate format, \Proj checks the words
before brackets in a function body. If such a word is a symbol (no
keyword), it can either be an array or a function call. \Proj needs
further information to determine the correct type and to make the
decision if to function call should generated in the output stream for
that word.

Since the symbol may be defined in an other file in the source tree and
\Proj operates on a single file only, the names of the functions in all
source files get read from an external file. When a symbol found in a
function body matches an entry in this file, a function call gets
generated in the output stream. (This is a pseudo call with empty
parameter list, \Proj doesn't support `OVERLOAD`ed functions yet.)


### Doxyfile  {#SubDoxyfile}

This is an external file format, designed and used as configuration
file for Doxygen. The file is located in the Doxygen directory. \Proj
evaluates it in order to operate on the same input and output as
Doxygen. It's used for run modi \ref SecModList and \ref SecModSyntax.

- \ref SecModList reads the path of the FB source input and the
  setting if this path should get scanned recursivly.

- \ref SecModSyntax additionally reads the output types (html, tex
  ,xml) and the paths for the output, in order to find the original
  Doxygen output and update it by files with corrected syntax
  highlighting.

Find details in the description of function Highlighter.doDoxy().

\note Doxygen allows multiple entries for some tags (lists), but \Proj
      doesn't support this. Especialy in tag `INPUT` only the first
      source path get parsed. So make sure that your path to the FB
      source code is at first place when you've more than one path in
      the list.


### *.html  {#SubInHtml}

In run mode \ref SecModSyntax \Proj reads special html files generated
by Doxygen (tags `GENERATE_HTML = YES` and `SOURCE_BROWSER = YES`),
containing the source code listings. Doxygen generates them in the path
specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and `HTML_OUTPUT =`. The
contents is based on the intermediate pseudo C format (= the filtered
output of \Proj) and therefor not useful for the documentation. \Proj
can update those files, using the real Fb source code and applying
Doxygen links and style information.

The emitter \ref SecEmmSyntax skips the file header and parses the
middle part (the listing) for hyper links. Those get collected in a
list to transfer them when the file update gets created.


### *.tex  {#SubInTex}

In run mode \ref SecModSyntax \Proj reads special tex files generated
by Doxygen (tags `GENERATE_LATEX = YES` and `SOURCE_BROWSER = YES`),
containing the source code listings. Doxygen generates them in the path
specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and `LATEX_OUTPUT =`. The
contents is based on the intermediate format (= the filtered output of
\Proj) and therefor not useful for the documentation. \Proj can update
those files, using Doxygen like style information on the real Fb source
code.

The emitter \ref SecEmmSyntax skips the file header and parses the
middle part (the listing) for hyper links. Those get collected in a
list to transfer them when the file update gets created.


### *.xml  {#SubInXml}

In run mode \ref SecModSyntax \Proj reads special xml files generated
by Doxygen (tags `GENERATE_XML = YES` and `SOURCE_BROWSER = YES`),
containing the source code listings. Doxygen generates them in the path
specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and `XML_OUTPUT =`. The
contents is based on the intermediate format (= the filtered output of
\Proj) and therefor not useful for the documentation. \Proj can update
those files, using Doxygen like style information on the real Fb source
code.

The emitter \ref SecEmmSyntax skips the file header and parses the
middle part (the listing) for hyper links. Those get collected in a
list to transfer them when the file update gets created.


### *.so / *.dll (External Moduls)  {#SubInPlugin}

Those files are optional, used in order to extend the \Proj features.
\Proj has an interface for external emitter modules (= plugins). These
are executable binaries, compiled and linked as a library for dynamic
linkage, either by using the FreeBASIC compiler or any other compiler /
linker combination able to create shared libraries. Those files may
have any name and get the system specific file name extension (suffix
`.so` on LINUX or `.dll` on other systems). See \ref SecEmmEx for
details.

An external emitter can get used in any run mode. It gets specified by
option \ref SecOptEmitter. The binary gets loaded at run-time.

\note There's no way to specify a path to a library file, so you have
      to executed \Proj in the folder of your plugin binary.

\note Regarding uniqueness, external emitters mustn't have file names
      like the internal emitter names.

\note Only one plugin can be active per \Proj run.


## Output  {#SubOutput}

Output files get generated by \Proj depending on the run mode. The
context of the output files depend on the emitter in use. In case of a
customized emitter setting (option \ref SecOptEmitter) make sure that
the emitter generates reasonable context for the output files specified
by the given run mode (find an overview in the first table in \ref
SecIntExe).


### *.c / *.h  {#SubOutCH}

Those files get generated in run mode \ref SecModFile (ie. by default
emitter \ref SecEmmCSource). They contain the C-like intermediate
format, transformed from the FB source input. The base file name stays
unchanged, and the suffix depends on the input file name: files with
suffix `.bas` get suffix to `.c`, all other input files get suffix
`.h`.

By default those files get written to the path `../c_src`, overriding
existend files. Customize the default output folder setting by option
\ref SecOptPath.


### fb-doc.lfn  {#SubOutLfn}

This file gets generated in run mode \ref SecModList by emitter \ref
SecEmmLfn. It contains the list of function names, used by the emitter
\ref SecEmmCSource. Place (and generate) this file in the Doxygen
folder near the Doxygen configuration file, since \Proj searches for
that file in the current directory when running as a Doxygen filter.


### *.html  {#SubOutHtml}

Those files get generated in run mode \ref SecModSyntax by emitter \ref
SecEmmSyntax when in the Doxygen configuration file `Doxyfile` the tags
`GENERATE_HTML` and `SOURCE_BROWSER` are both set to `YES`. They are
located in the folder specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and
`HTML_OUTPUT =`. In the original state (after being generated by
Doxygen) the files contain source code listings generated by Doxygen
based on the intermediate pseudo C syntax.

\Proj updates the files by copying the original header and footer
unchanged, but replacing the middle part with source listings based on
the original FB contents. FB keywords get highlighted and hyper links
from symbols to the text description get transfered to the new context.
During this process, a temporary file with suffix `*.html_` gets
generated and removed after successful operation.


### *.tex  {#SubOutTex}

Those files get generated in run mode \ref SecModSyntax by emitter \ref
SecEmmSyntax when in the Doxygen configuration file `Doxyfile` the tags
`GENERATE_LATEX` and `LATEX_SOURCE_CODE` are both set to `YES`. They are
located in the folder specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and
`LATEX_OUTPUT =`. In the original state (after being generated by
Doxygen) the files contain source code listings generated by Doxygen
based on the intermediate pseudo C syntax.

\Proj updates the files by copying the original header and footer
unchanged, but replacing the middle part with source listings based on
the original FB contents. FB keywords get highlighted and hyper links
from symbols to the text description get transfered to the new context.
During this process, a temporary file with suffix `*.tex_` gets
generated and removed after successful operation.


### *.xml  {#SubOutXml}

Those files get generated in run mode \ref SecModSyntax by emitter \ref
SecEmmSyntax when in the Doxygen configuration file `Doxyfile` the tags
`GENERATE_XML` and `XML_PROGRAMLISTING` are both set to `YES`. They are
located in the folder specified by the tags `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY =` and
`XML_OUTPUT =`. In the original state (after being generated by
Doxygen) the files contain source code listings generated by Doxygen
based on the intermediate pseudo C syntax.

\Proj updates the files by copying the original header and footer
unchanged, but replacing the middle part with source listings based on
the original FB contents. FB keywords get highlighted and hyper links
from symbols to the text description get transfered to the new context.
During this process, a temporary file with suffix `*.tex_` gets
generated and removed after successful operation.


# Folders  {#SecFolders}


## Current  {#SecFoldCurr}







\Proj currently uses two external files. It tries to load the
context when needed and continues without the context when the files
aren't present. \Proj searches for the files in the EXEPATH (the
folder of the \Proj binary).


## ../doc/c_src  {#SecFoldCsrc}

This folder gets created by \Proj to write the file output. It's
used to collect the translations from the `C_Source` emitter. The
back-end read its input from here.





## fb-doc.lfn  {#SecFileLfn}

The suffix lfn means list of function names. This file is used in the
C_Source emitter to create pseudo function calls in a function body. It
gets created by the ListOfFunction emitter when using (option
´--list-mode`) and it isn't used in Geany mode (option `--geany-mode`,
emitters GtkDocTemplates and DoxygenTemplates).

Allthough it's usually created by \Proj, it also can get
manipulated by any text editor.

The file contains the names of all functions in the source code.
Member functions of a UDT are listed as they are named in the
function body (ie. TypeName.FunctionName). The first line is empty.
Further lines contain the names, one in each line, including the dot
in case of a member function. The lines \b must be separated by a
single line feed character (LINUX line end = 'CHR(10)'). So be
careful when we edit on DOS / windows (ie. use Geany and switch to
LF line ends).

This file is needed when running as a filter for Doxygen to create
the caller and callees graphs. Therefor the bodys of the function
have to include the function calls. \Proj checks all words in a
function body against the known function names. Any match gets
emitted as a pseudo function call (with empty parameter list).

Since in this mode Doxygen serves the file names in any order and
\Proj gets started new for each file, it doesn't know about a
function declaration from file A when working on file B. Therefor the
function names have to be served from an external source. They get
read from this file at each program start.

The file offers an additional way to control the context of the caller
and callees graphs. Only functions listed in this file gets included
in the C source (and in the graphs).

When this file isn't present \Proj continues execution without any
message and the function bodys of the pseudo C code are empty. This
means no caller or callees graphs will be created.
